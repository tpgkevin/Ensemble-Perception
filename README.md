# Impact of unattended face bias in Ensemble-Perception
Spatial attention allows us to focus on information in a specific location in the visual field. It plays a vital role in most day to day tasks such as driving or looking for a lost object, but how do the things we aren't paying attention to impact us? While we do know that unattended objects hinder our performance, it is uncertain how they bias what we percieve. In this project, we directly tested for whether unattended information changes our visual representations of faces. To do so, we asked participants to focus to a stream of faces while another unattended stream simultationsly played. We then looked to see if the participants representation of the average emotion was biased to the unattended stream.
