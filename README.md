# Impact of unattended face bias in Ensemble-Perception
Spatial attention allows us to focus on information in a specific location in the visual field. It plays a vital role in most day to day tasks such as driving or looking for a lost object, but how do the things we aren't paying attention to impact us? While we do know that unattended objects hinder our performance, it is uncertain how they bias what we perceive. In this project, we directly tested whether unattended information changes our visual representations of faces. To do so, we asked participants to focus to a stream of faces while another unattended stream simultaneously played. We then looked to see if the participants' representation of the average emotion was biased to the unattended stream. We ran three versions of this experiment to check for both reproducibility of the results as well as handling some possible edge cases. Overall, we found consistent results showing a bias to the unattended field.

## Experiment 1
In this version of the experiment, participants were shown 2 simultaneous set of faces and told to pay attention to one side. The faces ranged in emotion from happy to sad and participants were instructed to report what they believed to be the average of the emotions they were paying attention to. This experiment had three conditions as the unattended faces could on average match, be sadder, or be happier than the attended face.

Participants performed well overall and there was a statistically significant pattern of bias towards the unattended faces (p=0.014).

## Experiment 2
The second version of the experiment is very similar to the first except that a different dataset of faces was used which ranges from happy to angry to sad. This experiment was run to ensure the results are reproducible and not specific to the previous dataset.

We saw similar results in this experiment as well. There was again a bias to the unattended faces as confirmed by a within-subject ANOVA (p=0.002).

## Experiment 3
The third experiment was mostly identical to the previous one with a few extra conditions. We wanted to make sure that the effect we were finding was not due to a similarity effect and that the results would presist across faces with significantlly varying emotions. This experiment once again replicated the previous results across all conditions.
