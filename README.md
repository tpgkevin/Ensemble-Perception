# Impact of unattended face bias in Ensemble-Perception
Spatial attention allows us to focus to relevent information in a specific visual field, and it plays a vital role in most day to day tasks such as driving or looking for a lost object. It is well known that unattended information is not fully ignored and still impacts performace and speed. However, it is uncertain whether the unattended information biases what we percieve. In this project, we directly tested for whether unattended information changes our visual representations of faces. To do so, we asked participants to focus to a stream of faces while another unattended stream simultationsly played. We then looked to see if the participants representation of the average emotion was biased to the unattended stream.
